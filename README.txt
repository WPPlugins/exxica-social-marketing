== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin have a paid service? =
Our plugin comes with a 45 day trial period, so you are free to use all premium features for 45 days. If you wish to keep using it after that, it's €9.99/month. This is to cover our server expenses. 
There is another option, where you can buy the complete publishing server solution for a larger, one-time fee, but this is intended for larger companies.

= What is the requirements of my server? =
Our plugin uses [PHP cURL](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) to transfer publication data to our server, this is the only thing that is required by your server. If you are unsure if you have it, the plugin will check for it and tell you if you don't.

= What if I have discovered a bug? =
If you have discovered a bug or something that you are not happy with, please let us know at support@exxica.com.

= I have authorized, but my settings page is not showing any publishing options, why? =
Did you remember to press the **Refresh** link? This will sync your server to ours and enabling your publishing options.

= Why isn't Social Marketing Scheduler available in my language? =
We only have capacity to translate this plugin for English and Norwegian users. If you wish to contribute, please feel free to do so by using a gettext translator (www.poedit.net) and sending the files to us (.mo and .po).

= Why can't I delete publications that's been published? =
You cannot delete them after their time has expired (and they are published) because we think you should have a record of what you have published at any time. There may be a feature in the future to give you an option. But generally we recommend keeping all publications on record, that way you can duplicate old publications, and see how often you've posted them before and with what text or image. You can, of course, remove publications before they publish.
